## **Problem Statement**
Employee attrition is the gradual reduction in employee numbers. Employee attrition happens when the size of your workforce diminishes over time.Â 

It is so expensive because organizations pay direct exit costs when an employee leaves and incur additional costs to recruit and train new hires.
 
In this project, we have a dataset on the former employees(provided by IBM). And we have to build a model to predict whether a particular employee is likely to leave or not based on some given attributes.
